Main file to run the experiment:
>> mainExperiment_2

Notes:
mainExperiment_2.m uses datasets stored in GIT\data\.
	(the older version mainExperiment.m has hard coded paths)
some extra data is also stored in .\data\.
	(i.e. GIT\sw_tst\201011_Fusion_2018_Amers_tst2\data\.)

Important:
Matlab code in Fusion2018 assumes a recent Matlab version
(in particular rdivision(.) or ./ must support the recent feature "allow compatible sizes")
