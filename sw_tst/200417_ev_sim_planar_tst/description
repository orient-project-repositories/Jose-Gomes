Obective:
	Get the Panoramic Renderer to work. Relies on ESIM. 
    This moves virtual camera over an image (.jpg file, for example), allowing for the generation of events.

Requisites:
    ESIM correctly installed. All files should be present if the simulator has been correclty installed.
    Image files to be used (default ones are available with the simulator as well).

Output:
    Produces topics similar to a DAVIS camera using rpg_ros_driver, namely events and images.


Instructions (adapted from https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_esim/wiki/Planar-Renderer):
    
    First set the absolute paths in example.conf (namely, replace "user" in the path with the correct user, in both "calib_filename" and "renderer_texture").
    The "renderer_texture" parameter is where the image to be used is selected.

        roscd esim_ros
        gedit cfg/example.conf 

    Run the simulator as follows:

        roslaunch esim_ros esim.launch config:=cfg/example.conf

    To visualize the output of the simulator, you can open rviz (from a new terminal) as follows:

        roscd esim_visualization
        rviz -d cfg/esim.rviz

    You can also open rqt for more visualizations, as follows:

        roscd esim_visualization
        rqt --perspective-file cfg/esim.perspective
