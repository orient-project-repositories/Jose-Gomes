\epigraph{We are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size}{--- \textup{Bernard De Chartres}}

\epigraph{``Ex nihilo nihil fit" (Nothing comes from nothing)}{--- \textup{Parmenides}}
