% Comments (lines starting with \%) do not appear in the final document.
%   See in the following: inline, own-line, own-line & numbered equations

This is a demo tex file. Example of one equation, inline with the paragraph is
$ \sum\limits_i {a_i  + b_i } $ .
%
The same equation can be shown in its own line:
$$ \sum\limits_i {a_i  + b_i } \ \ . $$
%
The same equation occupying its own line and being numbered, looks like this: 
%
\begin{equation}
 \sum\limits_i {a_i  + b_i }
 \label{eq:first_eq}  \ \ .
\end{equation}

Another equation inline $y=x+y$, which is completely different from Eq.\ref{eq:first_eq} -- this is an illustration on how to reference numbered (labeled) equations.
