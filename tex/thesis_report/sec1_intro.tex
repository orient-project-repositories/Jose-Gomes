\section{Introduction}

Many modern video surveillance systems encompass pan-tilt cameras due to the flexibility they provide in selecting the fields-of-view, as compared to using just fixed cameras. Although patent the great potential of using the pan-tilt cameras, one has to design pan and tilt controllers whose effectiveness directly impacts on the surveillance performance.
